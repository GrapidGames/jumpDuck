So I am finding that I need experience to land a job as a game programmer. I had a crazy idea last night to create this experience rather than wait for another company to create the experience for me. 

We are looking to gather a group of 4 or 5 people to learn unity and push out a few games over the summer.

Rather than just doing it recreationally, we want to make this much closer to an indie development environment. It will be closer to a job than just a fun side project. 

We cannot pay anyone (including ourselves) anything until games get pushed out. We obviously have no idea how much they will make, but all contributors will make the same amount, regardless of how much or little. If you want to do this, do it for the reason of gaining experience and being able to say and show that you've pushed out actual games.

We will mainly be meeting on second shift, as we have to support ourselves with first shift jobs.
